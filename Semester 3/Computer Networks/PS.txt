p = probability of success
n = sample size
N =  number of simulations
mu = population mean
sigma = population standard deviation
q = probability of failure
theta = population parameters for normal distribution
alpha = significance level (0,1), but in application it will belong in {0.05, 0.01, 0.001}
(1 - alpha) = confidence level
TS = test statistic 
TS0 = TS with theta = theta0, observerd value of TS
RR = rejection region
P-value = minimum threshold of rejection (smallest alpha for which we still reject H0)
ztest = known variance (known sigma)
ttest = unknown variance (unknown sigma)
H0 = the null hypotesis
H1 = the alternative hypotesis
	theta < theta0 => left-tailed test
	theta > theta0 => right-tailed test
	theta != theta0 => two-tailed test
vartest2 = used with two-tailed test
H = 0 (not rejected) or 1 (rejected)
sample variance = var(x)
sample standard deviation = std(x)
sample mean = mean(x)
norminv -> used for theoretical quantile
